# A2D2: AI-driven Autonomous Drone-based Detection Network for Wildfires

Annually, wildfires cause substantial property damage and loss of human lives, emphasizing the critical need for improved early detection to minimize these impacts. This project addresses significant limitations in current unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) missions, marked by labor-intensive tasks such as manual path planning, control, and data analysis. These constraints impede the full potential of UAVs in detecting wildfires, particularly in regions with limited firefighting resources. This project aims to design and develop an AI-driven Autonomous Drone Detection (A2D2) system, utilizing deep learning models to detect signs of smoke or flame and automatically control the droneâ€™s flight paths for optimal positioning and view angles, enhancing detection accuracy. The proposed research comprises three key components: first, training a deep computer vision model for fire and smoke detection; second, utilizing detection results as rewards to train a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model for real-time drone path control and maneuvering; and finally, testing and fine-tuning the entire system in both simulated and real environments. This project is innovative in its approach by employing object detection results to train a DRL drone control model, compared to previous studies that typically used fixed or moving marks in DRL to train models for other tasks like drone landing or following. The proposed solution for this project enables a drone to emulate the heuristic operational procedure of a human pilot, involving searching, flying over for confirmation, and navigating around for more detailed observation.
