# A2D2: AI-driven Autonomous Drone-based Detection Network for Wildfires in Large-scale Areas

Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in wildfire detection and surveillance. However, current effective drone operations require the collaborative work of a team of personnel, including GIS and map specialists, drone operators, imagery analysts, and even more. Such efforts limit the great potential of using drones for early wildfire detection, especially in large-scale areas such as forests. This project aims to design an autonomous drone network comprised of managed nodes (drone stations) that automate drone flight scheduling, path routing, and recharging. The system leverages real-time AI-driven deep-learning models to analyze drone camera imagery, identifying early signs of wildfires such as flames, smoke, or thermal hotspots. Any detected events are displayed/alerted in a central console program tagged with drone images, timestamps, and geographic locations for firefighters to respond rapidly.
The system proposed in this project aims to achieve early wildfire detection in large-scale areas without human intervention.
